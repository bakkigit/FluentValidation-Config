✅ Successfully Implemented FluentValidation in .NET

🚀 What I Did
Installed FluentValidation using NuGet 📦
Created a Model (User with properties like Name, Age, and Email) 👤
Defined Validation Rules using AbstractValidator<T> ✅
Name must not be empty and at least 3 characters long 🔡
Age must be greater than 18 🔞
Email must be a valid format 📧
Validated User Input by calling Validate() 🔍
Handled Errors by checking ValidationResult.Errors and displaying error messages ❌

🎯 Why This Matters
✔ Clean Code – Validation logic is separate from business logic 🧹
✔ Reusable & Maintainable – Easy to modify and extend 🔄
✔ Better Data Integrity – Ensures only valid data is processed 🔐
✔ Improved Error Handling – Provides clear and structured messages 📢

Now, my application enforces proper validation, making it more robust and user-friendly! 💪🔥
